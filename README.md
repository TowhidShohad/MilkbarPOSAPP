Project Report- POS SYSTEM




Project Report: POS System
1. Introduction
The Point of Sale (POS) system developed in this project provides a comprehensive solution for managing sales, inventory, and reporting for a retail store. The system streamlines the sales process, allows for real-time inventory tracking, and generates detailed transaction reports. The system was built using Microsoft Visual Studio (MS VS) with C# for the front-end and Microsoft SQL Server for the back-end database.

2. System Proposal
2.1. Problem Statement
Milkbar Retail, a local retail store, was facing challenges in managing its sales operations efficiently due to their reliance on a manual system. The lack of scalability, real-time reporting, and security in the manual process led to operational inefficiencies and inconsistencies in transaction data. The business requires a robust system to manage sales transactions, store product and inventory data, and generate reports for business analytics.
2.2. Proposed Solution
The proposed POS system integrates inventory management, sales transaction processing, user authentication, and transaction reporting into a single application. It provides the following key features:
•	User Authentication: A secure login system with role-based access (e.g., cashier, manager).
•	Product Management: A module for adding, updating, and deleting products.
•	Sales Transaction Processing: A module that handles real-time transactions with automatic calculation of the total amount and product quantities.
•	Reporting: A report generation module for filtering transactions by date range or product, providing business analytics and insights.




3. System Proposal
3.1 Objectives
•	Develop a robust POS system that handles sales transactions, inventory management, and report generation.
•	Provide secure access to the system using a login module.
•	Enable users to perform CRUD operations on products and transactions.
•	Provide detailed transaction reports with options to filter by date range, product, and payment method.
3.2 Scope
The scope of this POS system includes:
•	Product Management: Ability to add, edit, delete, and view product details.
•	Transaction Management: Ability to process transactions, including adding products to the cart, applying discounts, and processing payments.
•	Reporting: Generate detailed reports on sales transactions, filtered by date, product, and other criteria, with export options.
4. System Design
4.1 Architectural Design
The POS system follows a 3-tier architecture:
1.	Presentation Layer: The user interface built using Windows Forms in C# provides interaction for the users.
2.	Business Logic Layer: Handles the core functionality of the application, including transaction processing, product management, and report generation.
3.	Data Layer: Uses Microsoft SQL Server to manage and store data related to products, transactions, and users.



4.2 Class Diagrams
Include a Class Diagram to illustrate the relationships between key entities, such as Product, Transaction, TransactionDetail, and User.
 
4.3 Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram
The ER Diagram shows the relationships between the tables in the database. The main tables are Products, Transactions, TransactionDetails, and Users.

5. Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
5.1 Functional Requirements
•	User Login: Only authenticated users can access the system, with role-based permissions for different user types (e.g., admin, cashier).
•	Product Management: Users can add, edit, delete, and view products. This includes details such as product name, price, and quantity.
•	Transaction Processing: Users can add items to a cart, apply discounts, and process payments.
•	Report Generation: Users can generate sales reports filtered by date range, product, and payment method.
5.2 Non-Functional Requirements
•	Security: The system should authenticate users and restrict unauthorized access.
•	Performance: The system must efficiently handle transactions and large datasets without performance degradation.
•	Usability: The user interface should be intuitive, with minimal training required for users.
Scalability: The system should be able to handle increasing amounts of data as the store grows

6. System Implementation
6.1. Technologies Used
•	Front-End: Microsoft Visual Studio (Windows Forms, C#)
•	Back-End: Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS)
•	Database Connectivity: ADO.NET (for database operations)

6.2 Database Design
The system uses Microsoft SQL Server to store data. The key tables include:
•	Products: Stores product information (ProductID, ProductName, Price, Quantity).
•	Transactions: Stores information about each transaction (TransactionID, TransactionDate, PaymentMethod, TotalAmount).
•	TransactionDetails: Stores details about the products involved in a transaction (TransactionDetailID, TransactionID, ProductID, Quantity, TotalPrice).
•	Users: Stores login credentials and user roles.

6.3. Modules Implemented
1.	Login Module:
o	Functionality: The system uses a secure login form to authenticate users based on their role (cashier, manager). Users can access the system only after successful authentication.
o	Implementation: The user’s credentials are validated against the Users table in SQL Server, and role-based access control is enforced.
o	 
 


2.	Product Management:
o	Functionality: This module allows managers to add, update, view, or delete product information such as product name, price, and available stock.
o	Implementation: CRUD operations are performed using SQL queries, and the data is updated in the Products table. The UI includes a form with product details and buttons for different operations.
o	 
3.	Transaction Processing:
o	Functionality: The cashier can add products to a transaction, specify quantities, and the system automatically calculates the total price. After payment, the transaction is processed and recorded in the database.
o	Implementation: The system inserts the transaction data into the Transactions table and records the details in the TransactionDetails table. The user can view the total and clear the form for a new transaction.
o	
o	 

4.	Report Generation:
o	Functionality: The manager can generate transaction reports based on selected criteria such as date range or product. This allows for real-time insights into sales performance.
o	Implementation: SQL queries retrieve filtered data from the Transactions and TransactionDetails tables, and the results are displayed in a DataGridView on the report form.
o	 


6.4. Sample SQL Scripts
Sample SQL scripts were used to create the necessary database structure, including tables for users, products, transactions, and transaction details, as well as inserting initial data into the database.
SQL code snippets SQL code snippets:
CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    Username NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    PasswordHash NVARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Role NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    Quantity INT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Transactions (
    TransactionID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    TransactionDate DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    TotalAmount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE TransactionDetails (
    TransactionDetailID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    TransactionID INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Transactions(TransactionID),
    ProductID INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Products(ProductID),
    Quantity INT NOT NULL,
    TotalPrice DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL
);
7 Testing and Quality Assurance
The system was thoroughly tested to ensure reliability and usability. This included:
•	Unit Testing: Each module was individually tested to ensure that functionality worked as expected.
•	Integration Testing: The system was tested as a whole to ensure that all modules worked together seamlessly.
•	User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Simulated users (cashiers and managers) tested the system to ensure that it met their business needs and was easy to use.
8. Conclusion
The POS system developed as part of this project meets the primary objectives of enhancing the operational efficiency of Milkbar Retail. It provides a secure, scalable, and easy-to-use solution for managing sales transactions, maintaining inventory, and generating reports. This system reduces manual data entry errors, improves inventory tracking, and gives business owners valuable insights through comprehensive reporting.
